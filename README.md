My Golang gRPC boilerplate

## test case
Bulubulu Planet is the most remote planet in the universe (relative to earth), scientist has found life thriving on the surface. Surprisingly they understand our language, but they only use letter "u" as vowel and the way they write "b" and "l" is swapped one another. Help scientist to communicate with them by translating our writings so they can understand.
